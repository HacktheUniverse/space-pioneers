### Description
Space Trail is like Oregon Trail... but in space.

This is a game that is intended to get kids interested and excited about the challenges of human space travel.

### Scenario
Earth is crowded and there are not many resources left.  There are many stars in the sky and perhaps, orbiting around one of them, is a new planet that we can call home.  A giant spaceship is contructed that will hopefully be able to transport a large group of 14,000 humans to settle on [Gliese_667_Cc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_667_Cc), which is 23.6 light-years away.  Even if our spaceship can travel 10% of the speed of light, it will still take 236 years to reach the planet.  This means that the people that reach the planet would be several generations removed from the original occupants of the ship.
