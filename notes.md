### Ship
- the ship contains a number of several different items to start with
- maybe later we can add the ability for the player to choose what # of items to bring along
- input to give your ship a name (with randomized examples)

challenges:
- need sustainable energy, food, air, and water
- systems need to be reliable
- minimum viable population > 14,000
- psychological challenges of being contained in a ship your whole life
- will future generations remember how to maintain/operate the ship?
- GCRs or galactic cosmic rays and damage human DNA (thick shielding in human-occupied areas)

### Event
- an event has a description
- an event can have choices
- each choice has some randomized chance of something occurring.  some choices high risk + high reward vs. playing it safe.
